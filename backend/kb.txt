Projects

1. Book Review Sentiment Analysis
- Built a full-stack system to classify Goodreads book reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
- Scraped data using BeautifulSoup and Requests.
- Preprocessed using NLTK and spaCy.
- Trained ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest).
- Fine-tuned transformers (BERT, LSTM, ELECTRA) using HuggingFace.
- Used weak supervision (TextBlob, VADER, HuggingFace models) + 200+ manually labeled examples for evaluation.
- Final ELECTRA model achieved ~82% accuracy.
- Deployed with Flask backend and basic UI.
Challenges: Lack of labeled data → solved using weak supervision. Class imbalance handled using stratified sampling and class weights.
Results: Real-time prediction through Flask API with interpretable results. Robust and scalable sentiment classification pipeline.

2. Website Generation from Text Prompt
- Users describe an idea (e.g., “a portfolio site for a photographer”) → platform builds website.
- Used OpenAI GPT-3 (text-davinci-003) to generate HTML, CSS, JS.
- Used DALL·E to generate images dynamically.
- Built 15 custom templates using HTML, CSS, JS.
- System matches prompt to template modules using token-to-block intent mapping.
Challenges: Aligning GPT output with handcrafted templates. Ensuring mobile responsiveness. DALL·E image prompt tuning.
Results: Generated 100+ websites. GPT wrote content (CTAs, headers), DALL·E generated visuals. Real-time site previews and exports.

3. Agentic AI Tutor (Visual + RAG)
- Personalized AI tutor for visual subjects.
- Uses object detection and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- Accepts user queries and adapts follow-ups based on prior questions.
- Supports diagrams, explanations, and visual walk-throughs.
Challenges: Building modular prompt chains and memory context.
Results: Responsive, educational assistant tailored to student learning paths.

4. Heart Disease Prediction
- Built a predictive model using the Framingham dataset.
- Used logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest.
- Deployed via Flask with simple UI for users to enter health stats.
- Showed heart disease risk probability.

5. Real Estate Price Prediction
- Built an end-to-end price prediction app using machine learning.
- Scraped housing data, performed feature engineering and outlier handling.
- Used Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for training.
- Deployed with a clean Flask UI for users to input location, sqft, BHK, etc.
- Delivered real-time predicted house price based on model inference.
Challenges: Encoding categorical features like location, handling sparse features.
Results: Highly interpretable and interactive app; showcased full ML lifecycle from data to deployment.
